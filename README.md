# Day Planner
Some days you want to explore your city, but don't know where to go. Why not say what you want to do and let an algorithm do the rest?

Hooks into the Yelp API. Constructs a graph over points of interest. Traverses the graph based on constraints you specify (taking into account operating hours of restaurants, etc) and outputs a set of valid plans for the day. Constraint system is robust but not user-friendly yet.
